I wrote an article for the 12 Devs of Xmas article series about how you can use a screen reader to test your website.

> A screen reader is a piece of assistive technology used by people who may need help reading what is on the screen. It’s commonly used by people with visual impairments (it’s one of the only ways blind people can use computers), and also by people with severe dyslexia. It reads out what is on the screen aloud, and can be connected to a braille output device for people who are also unable to hear, or just prefer braille.

It follows on from my other article on accessibility, [The Case For Web Accessibility](http://macr.ae/article/case-for-accessibility.html).
